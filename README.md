# Shadowfist
Shadowfist is a stealthy computer tool that lets you run commands, transfer files, and record keystrokes on a victim's machine. It uses a reverse shell and a custom TCP protocol to connect to your machine, making it difficult to detect. Use it responsibly for authorized penetration testing.
